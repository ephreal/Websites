# Websites
A collection of websites that I have created.

Website1 is made for a souvenir company. I was limited in what I could use (in terms of javascript, etc) because they were concerned about potential vulnerabilities. As I knew just enough code at the time to be dangerous, but not enough to be secure, I decided to acquiesce to their request and only used a little javascript to change pictures. Previously, they were creating a separate product window for each product color, calling each product color by a different product code, etc. It was a bit of a mess. This let them simplify their system a little bit.

In the actual site, there's a company logo at the top instead of the text. It looks marginally better with the logo because I designed the site with the logo in mind. I'm hoping they'll listen to my request for a small logo and let me handle the company_name text at the top. Having a small logo and styling the text through CSS would look better than how it looks right now. For now, it's just looking a little terrible because it lacks the picture.

In other cool things that I did, I created a json/python combo to auto create most of the code for me on the products page, and it even automatically inserts the code into the products.html. I think I'll reuse that on future websites because it's kinda nice to update a small area and have a large amount of code auto created (Assuming PHP/database queries are out).



If anyone has any recommendations on how to make this even better, please let me know. I haven't had any review of the code itself and it'd be a nice change to have valid code complaints rather than complaints about the color (and YES, the coloration IS far better than it used to be...just still not good).
