          <strong>Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!</strong> company_name provided
          the best customer service that I have experienced with any ASI vendor.
          Using a team approach, they were able to work with me to figure out
          solutions for my client's problems. The execution of the product was
          swift and the quality was outstanding. company_website gets it and they know
          how to stand out in the busy marketplace. I will be partnering with
          them again in the future.

          My client just got back in town this morning and said the rosewood pen and
          pencil sets looked fabulous! I am so pleased and this is the first time
          I've done a spot sale with them so that makes it doubly special. I've just
          gotten their company store and will recommend your products to be included.

          We had an order with company_name in December of 2009 at the busiest time
          of the year. We had a tight time frame with an in hands date to meet.
          I worked with customer services whe helped make sure art was received
          and art issues were resolved. The customer received the product several
          days ahead of their in hands date. They not only met customer
          expectations, but exceeded them.

        I recently worked with company_name on a bamboo pen for a new client program.
        there were 17 PO's and other items for this client going at the same time,
        most of which needed babysitting. HOWEVER; WOW company_website was phenomenal.
        I wish every vendor was as smooth and easy to work with as they were.
